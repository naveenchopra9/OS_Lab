The new process created by fork is called the child process.
The return value of fork in the child is 0, whereas the return value in the parent is the process ID of the new child.

Hence, if pid=0, the process is child process. 
We can print the current process id by "getpid()" and parent process id by "getppid()" 

Whereas, if pid!=0, the process is parent process. 
We can print its child process by printing the "pid" variable value.
